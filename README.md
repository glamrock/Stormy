##Notice
Stormy is currently under heavy development, and only usable by developers.

Stormy
=========

*Stormy* is a wizard to help people create Tor Hidden Services with just a couple of clicks. Originally, it was setup to install Ghost (a swanky nodejs-based blog platform), but has since expanded to include Jabber, IRC, Cozy (personal cloud), and Diaspora (social media) options.


##Options

Running `one-click-blog.sh` will install Ghost and Tor, as well as configuring torrc and nginx.

Running `stormy.sh` will guide you through several options to set up a Tor hidden service that meets your needs.

There are plans to package Stormy in the future.

**Reminder:** Always create hidden services on *their own machine*. ***Always***.

###Dependencies
* Ghost
 * Python 2.4+
 * Nodejs
 * npm: supervisor
