Stormy
=========

*Stormy* is a wizard to help people create Tor Hidden Services with just a couple of clicks. Currently, it's setup to install Ghost (a swanky nodejs-based blog platform). Another option is to create an application using [APAF](https://apaf.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), but if you know how to code twisted-based applications in freaking python, then you're probably not even reading this :P

##Options
````
-g, --ghost
--irc ircd-hybrid
--cozy, --cloud
-w, --website
-t, --tor
--jabber
--mixtape
--wiki, --moinmoin
--rss tt-rss
--purge <nick>
````

**Reminder:** Always create hidden services on *their own machine*. ***Always***.
